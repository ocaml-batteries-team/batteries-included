    `UNIFORM makes a histogram for uniformly distributed data, with
    sample size 1028, which gives a 99.9% confidence interval with a
    5% margin of error assuming a normal distribution

    `BIASED uses an exponentially decaying sample of 1028 elements,
    which offers a 99.9% confidence level with a 5% margin of error
    assuming a normal distribution, and an alpha factor of 0.015,
    which heavily biases the sample to the past 5 minutes of
    measurements.
