<h1>Installing OCaml with GODI</h1>
<p>
In this section, we will see how to install OCaml using GODI, a
package manager designed specifically to help OCaml programmers
install, upgrade or uninstall applications, libraries and tools.
While starting with GODI is not the easiest of tasks, using GODI
is generally the best way of having a robust installation of
OCaml and all the important tools.
</p>
<p>
This tutorial is meant for users of Linux, MacOS X, BSD and other
variants of Unix. It could also be completed to work for Windows,
but that's a new story altogether.
</p>
<h2>Necessary tools</h2>
<h3>Under Linux/BSD</h3>
<ol>
<li>Open a terminal. A terminal is a small utility used to communicate
instructions to the computer in a minimal programming language called
<emph>the shell</emph> or the <emph>command interpreter</emph>.
<ul>
<li>Under Linux and BSD, to open a terminal, you typically need to open menu
Applications, submenu Accessories and choose Terminal. </li>
<li>Under recent versions MacOS X, to open a terminal, you
may push keys &lt;Command&gt;+&lt;Spacebar&gt; and write "Terminal".</li>
<li>Under all versions MacOS X, to open a terminal, you
may open directory Applications and choose Terminal.app .</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Once the terminal is opened, you should see a black box and a blinking text cursor,
somethine along the lines of
<code class="terminal">
yoric@Blefuscu:~$ <span style="text-decoration:blink">_</span>
</code>. Here, <code>yoric</code> is my name and <code>Blefuscu</code> is the name
of the computer I'm using. Depending on your name, the name of the computer you're using
and the configuration of your computer, you may see something different. However,
you will probably see the <code>$</code>.
</li>
<li>
Install GCC, m4, wget, make, gzip, bzip2 and patch. The method to do this depends on your
version of Linux/BSD.
<ul>
 <li>Under Ubuntu or Debian, write
<code class="terminal">
sudo apt-get install gcc m4 wget make gzip bzip2
</code> and press &lt;Enter&gt;. Accept the various suggestions.</li>
 <li>Under Fedora or Red Hat, write
<code class="terminal">
sudo yum install gcc m4 wget make gzip bzip2
</code> and press &lt;Enter&gt;. Accept the various suggestions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Once installation is complete, you may close the terminal.
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Under MacOS X</h3>
<ol>
<li>Find your Apple Developer Tools, which are provided by Apple with your
copy of MacOS X. If your version of MacOS X came as a DVD,
they are on the DVD, otherwise they are on a different CD.</li>
<li>Install XCode from that CD/DVD. XCode is a set of
tools for developers, including a text editor for programmers,
several programming languages, etc. Unfortunately, no OCaml (yet).</li>
<li>Go
to <a href="http://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/wget/wget-1.11.tar.gz">http://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/wget/wget-1.11.tar.gz</a>.</li>
<li>Your browser may offer you to open the file with
some decompressor -- depending on what software is installed
on your computer, this decompressor may be called file-roller, Ark,
ShrinkWrap... Choose rather to save the file.
You will need to choose a directory. In case of doubt,
directory <code>/tmp</code> is a good choice.</li>
<li>Open a terminal. A terminal is a small utility used to communicate
instructions to the computer in a minimal programming language called
<emph>the shell</emph> or the <emph>command interpreter</emph>.
<ul>
<li>Under recent versions MacOS X, to open a terminal, you
may push keys &lt;Command&gt;+&lt;Spacebar&gt; and write "Terminal".</li>
<li>Under all versions MacOS X, to open a terminal, you
may open directory Applications and choose Terminal.app .</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Once the terminal is opened, you should see a black box and a blinking text cursor,
somethine along the lines of
<code class="terminal">
yoric@Blefuscu:~$ <span style="text-decoration:blink">_</span>
</code>. Here, <code>yoric</code> is my name and <code>Blefuscu</code> is the name
of the computer I'm using. Depending on your name, the name of the computer you're using
and the configuration of your computer, you may see something different. However,
you will probably see the <code>$</code>.
</li>
<li>
In the terminal, type <code class="terminal">cd /tmp</code> -- if you have saved your
files to another directory than <code>/tmp</code>, replace appropriately.
</li>
<li>
Still in the terminal, type the following commands (press &lt;Enter&gt; at the end of each of the following lines)
<code class="terminal">
tar -zxf wget-1.11.tar.gz
cd wget-1.11/
./configure
</code>
</li>
<li>
You should see something along the lines of
<code class="terminal">
yoric@Blefuscu:/tmp/wget-1.11$ ./configure

</code>
Once you have reached that stage, write
<code class="terminal">
make
</code>
This will instruct your computer to turn wget from
a source code (i.e. a description of what the computer
<emph>should do</emph>) into an application. By the
way, wget is a downloading program, which is used
by GODI.
</li>
<li>
You should see something along the lines of
<code class="terminal">
yoric@Blefuscu:/tmp/wget-1.11$ make
cd src && make CC='gcc' CPPFLAGS='' DEFS='-DHAVE_CONFIG_H -DSYSTEM_WGETRC=\"/usr/local/etc/wgetrc\" -DLOCALEDIR=\"/usr/local/share/locale\"' CFLAGS='-O2 -Wall' LDFLAGS='' LIBS='-ldl -lrt  -lssl -lcrypto ' DESTDIR='' prefix='/usr/local' exec_prefix='/usr/local' bindir='/usr/local/bin' infodir='/usr/local/share/info' mandir='/usr/local/share/man' manext='1'

make[1]: Nothing to be done for `all'.
make[1]: Leaving directory `/tmp/wget-1.11/windows'
</code>
Once you have reached that stage, write
<code class="terminal">
sudo make install
</code>
and enter your password when prompted. This will actually install <code>wget</code>.
</li>
<li>
Once installation is complete, you can close your terminal.
</li>
</ol>

<h2>Downloading and unpacking GODI</h2>
<ol>


<li>Go to <a href="http://godi.camlcity.org/godi/index.html"
target="godi_frame">http://godi.camlcity.org/godi/index.html</a> and
choose "Download GODI"</li>
<li>Your browser may offer you to open the file with
some decompressor -- depending on what software is installed
on your computer, this decompressor may be called file-roller, Ark,
ShrinkWrap... Choose rather to save the file.
You will need to choose a directory. In case of doubt,
directory <code>/tmp</code> is a good choice.</li>
</li>
<li>In your decompressor, choose to extract the contents of the file.
You may choose whichever directory suits you -- once this tutorial
is complete, you will not need the files anymore. In case of doubt,
directory <code>/tmp</code> is a good choice.</li>
<li>Once extraction is complete, you may close the decompressor.
Remember in which directory you have extracted the file. For
the rest of this tutorial, we will assume that you have chosen
directory <code>/tmp</code>.</li>
<ol>
<li>Open a terminal. A terminal is a small utility used to communicate
instructions to the computer in a minimal programming language called
<emph>the shell</emph> or the <emph>command interpreter</emph>.
<ul>
<li>Under Linux and BSD, to open a terminal, you typically need to open menu
Applications, submenu Accessories and choose Terminal. </li>
<li>Under recent versions MacOS X, to open a terminal, you
may push keys &lt;Command&gt;+&lt;Spacebar&gt; and write "Terminal".</li>
<li>Under all versions MacOS X, to open a terminal, you
may open directory Applications and choose Terminal.app .</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Once the terminal is opened, you should see a black box and a blinking text cursor,
somethine along the lines of
<code class="terminal">
yoric@Blefuscu:~$ <span style="text-decoration:blink">_</span>
</code>. Here, <code>yoric</code> is my name and <code>Blefuscu</code> is the name
of the computer I'm using. Depending on your name, the name of the computer you're using
and the configuration of your computer, you may see something different. However,
you will probably see the <code>$</code>.
</li>



<li>
In the terminal, write
<code class="terminal">
cd /tmp
</code>
and press &lt;Enter&gt;.
If you have unpacked GODI in a directory other than <code>/tmp</code>,
you should replace with the name of the directory you have chosen.
</li>
<li>
Still in the terminal, write
<code class="terminal">
ls
</code>
This should display a list of everything in the directory in which you have unpacked
GODI. This may look like
<code class="terminal">
yoric@Blefuscu:/tmp$ ls
acroread_1000_1000  gconfd-yoric                      keyring-2MSlZc   orbit-yoric     totem.yoric.3483895353
file8eok1j          godi-rocketboost-20080630         mapping-yoric    plugtmp         virtual-yoric.AcfbLs
filemjfCnI          godi-rocketboost-20080630.tar.gz  ocaml797c01pipe  ssh-MKJzlx5913
</code>
</li>
<li>
Most files are unimportant for the installation of GODI. The important one is the one whose name starts with
<code>godi</code> and doesn <emph>not</emph> end with <code>.tar.gz</code>. The exact name will depend on when
you read this tutorial, as the numbers at the end represent the day the last version of GODI was published.
For the next few steps, we will assume that the name is <code>godi-rocketboost-20080630</code>. This is the
name of the directory in which you may find the contents of the file you downloaded earlier, by the way.
</li>
<li>
Enter that directory in the terminal, by writing
<code class="terminal">
cd godi-rocketboost-20080630/
</code>
and by the way, write <code class="terminal">ls</code> to check that you're in the correct directory.
You should see something along the lines of
<code class="terminal">
yoric@Blefuscu:/tmp/godi-rocketboost-20080630$ ls
<span style="font-weight:bold">bootstrap  bootstrap_stage2  cleanup  godi-tools  godi-tools-boot</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold">README     run</span>
</code>
The files we're interested in are <code>bootstrap</code> and <code>bootstrap_stage2</code>, which
are both used to pursue the installation of GODI and OCaml.
</li>
<li>
At this point, you'll need to decide which version of OCaml you're interested in and where you want
to install GODI. In case of doubt, OCaml 3.11 is a safe bet and directory <code>~/usr/local</code>
is a nice directory. For the rest of this tutorial, we'll assume that you have chosen these options.
Otherwise, write down the name of the directory you have elected, we'll need it later.
</li>
<li>
Start the GODI installer by writing
<code class="terminal">
./bootstrap --section 3.11 --prefix ~/usr/local
</code>
You should see something along the lines of
<code class="terminal">
*** Welcome to GODI, the O'Caml source distribution
*** RocketBoost bootstrap
    GODI has been created by Gerd Stolpmann (mailto: gerd@gerd-stolpmann.de),
    and is derived from the NetBSD pkgsrc system.

    A number of packaging tools are now compiled and/or installed. Messages
    are written to bootstrap.log.

Configuring make framework:
Looking up system commands...
/usr/bin/patch works fine
/usr/bin/patch can make backups with -V simple -b -z
/usr/bin/patch can remove empty files with -E
/usr/bin/patch can reject reverse patches with -N
/usr/bin/patch can be silent with -s

Selected release: 3.11
Installing into:  /home/yoric/usr/local

Press [Return] to begin with the installation; press [CTRL-C] to abort.
</code>
</li>
<li>
Press &lt;Enter&gt; and wait until this stage of installation is complete.
You should see things such as
<code class="terminal">
===> Creating sample godi.conf
===> Building ocamlrun
===> Installing preliminary version of godi_console
===> Installing preliminary version of the make framework (godi-tools)

Bootstrap was successful!

Please remember to add
    ~/usr/local/bin
and
    ~/usr/local/sbin
to your PATH environment variable.
If necessary, please remember to add
    ~/usr/local/man
to your MANPATH environment variable.

An example godi.conf file has been created for you in the current
directory, and it has been installed in ~/usr/local/etc.

Selected GODI section: 3.11
  (to change this, edit ~/usr/local/etc/godi.conf)

It is now recommended to start bootstrap_stage2 to download and
install a minimum set of packages. For more information, see the
file README.
yoric@Blefuscu:/tmp/godi-rocketboost-20080630$
</code>
</li>
<li>
We will need to follow the above instructions. To do so,
we will need to edit the contents of a file and add two lines.
<ul>
 <li>Under Linux or BSD, that file is usually called
<code>~/.bashrc</code>. To edit it, write
<code class="terminal">
gedit ~/.bashrc
</code>
or
<code class="terminal">
kwrite ~/.bashrc
</code>
(gedit and kwrite are just two text editors, you may use another editor
if you prefer). If the file you see in your editor is empty, you have
a problem: your configuration has a different name, which I can't guess.
You may wish to try <code>gedit ~/.tcshrc</code> or <code>gedit ~/.zshrc</code>
instead. Assuming that the file isn't empty, add the following two lines at the end:
<code class="example">
export PATH=~/usr/local/bin:~/usr/local/sbin:$PATH
export MANPATH=~/usr/local/man:$MANPATH
</code>
You may save the file and quit your text editor.
These two lines instructs your computer to look for additional programs
in directories <code>~/usr/local/bin:~/usr/local/sbin</code>
and for additional manual pages inside directory <code>~/usr/local/man</code>.
</li>
<li>Under recent versions of MacOS X, that file is usually called
<code>~/.bashrc</code>. Under older versions of MacOS X, it was
called <code>~/.tcshrc</code>. To open this file, write
<code class="terminal">
open -a TextEdit .bashrc
</code>
if the file is empty, close TextEdit and try instead
<code class="terminal">
open -a TextEdit .tcshrc
</code>
Once you have found the correct file, add the following two lines at the end:
<code class="example">
export PATH=~/usr/local/bin:~/usr/local/sbin:$PATH
export MANPATH=~/usr/local/man:$MANPATH
</code>
You may save the file and quit your text editor.
These two lines instructs your computer to look for additional programs
in directories <code>~/usr/local/bin:~/usr/local/sbin</code>
and for additional manual pages inside directory <code>~/usr/local/man</code>.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
We now need to instruct the computer to use these new preferences. To do so, write
<code class="terminal">
~/.bashrc
</code>
(if the file isn't called <code>~/.bashrc</code>, replace with <code>~/.tcshrc</code>
or the name of the file).
</li>
<li>
We're now ready to install our first programs using GODI. Actually, our first programs
will be the tools required to complete the installation of GODI. To do so, write
<code class="terminal">
./bootstrap_stage2
</code>
This will download and install a few OCaml-related programs on your computer.
The installation may last 10 minutes or more and present plenty of weird messages,
so don't worry -- and take a break.
</li>
<li>
Once this is done, we're finished with GODI. Only a few more steps and we'll be able to use
OCaml Batteries Included.
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Ledit and OCaml Batteries Included</h2>
<ol>
<li>In a terminal, write
<code class="terminal">
godi_console
</code>
</li>
<li>
This should open the GODI console, i.e. the menu-based installer for OCaml packages.
The first menu looks like
<code class="terminal">
+--------------------------------------------+

          >>> Main Menu <<<

          [1]   Update the list of available packages

          [2]   Select source packages

          [3]   Exit program

</code>
</li>
<li>
Press &lt;1&gt; to have GODI download the list of available packages.
A package is either a complete application, a small tool or a library
which may be useful for OCaml programmers. You will need a few such
tools and libraries
in your career as a OCaml programmer and GODI is the right place to
look for them.
</li>

Once the download is complete, press &lt;x&gt; to exit the

You should now start looking for the package containing Batteries Included.
It's called <code>godi-batteries</code> and it's a few pages further into
the list of packages. On my computer, it's numbered 72 but, once again,
this may change. To navigate between pages, press &lt;n&gt; (to go to
the next page) or &lt;p&gt; (to go to the next page).

As with Ledit, enter the description by writing the number of the package,
press &lt;b&gt; to mark Batteries for installation and press &lt;x&gt;
to return to the previous menu.

One last menu before installation actually proceeds:
<code class="terminal">
------------------ GODI Console --------------

      >>> Installation <<<

GODI is going to
 - remove 0 package(s)
 - upgrade 0 package(s) from source
 - build 10 package(s) from source

Press [ok] to execute this plan.

Important note: There are packages with configuration
options or build messages you might not yet have seen:

Package conf-zlib:
  Options: GODI_ZLIB_INCDIR, GODI_ZLIB_LIBDIR
  Build message:
  The Zlib C library (version 1.1.3 or up) needs to be installed.
  Available options for godi.conf:

  - GODI_ZLIB_INCDIR: Where zlib.h can be found. Set this option
    if the installed zlib library is not found.

  - GODI_ZLIB_LIBDIR: Where libz can be found. Set this option
    if the installed zlib library is not found.


To set options, exit this menu, select the packages
in question, and invoke their [c]onfigure menu.
