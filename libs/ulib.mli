(** Heavyweight strings ("ropes")
 
This module implements ropes as described in
Boehm, H., Atkinson, R., and Plass, M. 1995. Ropes: an alternative to
strings. Softw. Pract. Exper. 25, 12 (Dec. 1995), 1315-1330.
 
Ropes are an alternative to strings which support efficient operations:
- determining the length of a rope in constant time
- appending or prepending a small rope to an arbitrarily large one in amortized constant time
- concat, substring, insert, remove operations in amortized logarithmic time
- access to and modification of ropes in logarithmic time
 
{8 Functional nature and persistence}
 
All operations are non-destructive: the original rope is never modified. When a
new rope is returned as the result of an operation, it will share as much data
as possible with its "parent". For instance, if a rope of length [n] undergoes
[m] operations (assume [n >> m]) like set, append or prepend, the modified
rope will only require [O(m)] space in addition to that taken by the
original one.
 
However, Rope is an amortized data structure, and its use in a persistent setting
can easily degrade its amortized time bounds. It is thus mainly intended to be used
ephemerally. In some cases, it is possible to use Rope persistently with the same
amortized bounds by explicitly rebalancing ropes to be reused using [balance].
Special care must be taken to avoid calling [balance] too frequently; in the limit,
calling [balance] after each modification would defeat the purpose of amortization.
 

{8 Limitations}

The length of ropes is limited to approximately 700 Mb on 32-bit 
architectures, 220 Gb on 64 bit architectures.

        indexes are out of bounds they are automatically clipped.
