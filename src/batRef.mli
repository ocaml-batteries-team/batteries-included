(** Operations on references.

    References are mutable values, i.e. "variables" which may actually
    change value during their life-time, as variables in imperative
    languages. References can be understood as 1-cell arrays and
    are typically used to implement imperative algorithms in OCaml.

    References are useful but don't abuse them.

  (**Assign a reference temporarily.

     [protect r v body] sets the value of [r] to [v] and executes
     [body]. Once body has been executed, whether termination happens
     as a consequence of regular evaluation or exception, the previous
     value of [r] is restored. *)
