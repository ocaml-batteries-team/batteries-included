(**
   Common signatures for data structures.
*)


(** A signature for data structures which have a
    [map : ('a -> 'b) -> ('a t -> 'b t)] operation.

    If you create a new data structure, you should make it compatible
    with [Mappable].
*)
module type Mappable = sig
  type 'a mappable (** The data structure, e.g. ['a List.t] *)

  val map : ('a -> 'b) -> ('a mappable -> 'b mappable)
    (** [map f e] applies [f] to every element of [e] and returns the corresponding data structure *)
end

module type OrderedType =
sig
  type t
  val compare : t -> t -> int
    (** A total ordering function
        This is a two-argument function [f] such that
        [f e1 e2] is zero if the values [e1] and [e2] are equal,
        [f e1 e2] is strictly negative if [e1] is smaller than [e2],
        and [f e1 e2] is strictly positive if [e1] is greater than [e2].
        Example: a suitable ordering function is the generic structural
        comparison function {!Pervasives.compare}. *)
end

(** Monads are a design pattern which may be used to enforce strong
    functional or non-functional constraints on the manipulation of
    resources, while remaining in the world of functional programming.
    For instance, monads may serve to implement approximations of a
    types-and-effects type system, to enforce functional use of arrays
    or other mutable data structures, or to enforce the fact that only
    files opened for writing may be actually used for writing.

    For more information on monads, see
    {{:http://enfranchisedmind.com/blog/2007/08/06/a-monad-tutorial-for-ocaml/}
    A Monad Tutorial for Ocaml}.

    This definition is compatible with the standard syntax extension
    for monads.  For more information, see
    {{:http://www.cas.mcmaster.ca/~carette/pa_monad/} the
    documentation of pa_monad}.

(** Signature for monads *)
module type Monad = sig

  (** The type of a monad producing values of type ['a].*)
  type 'a m

  (** Monadic binding.

      [bind m f] executes first [m] then [f], using the
      result of [m]. *)
  val bind : 'a m -> ('a -> 'b m) -> 'b m

  (**Return a value, that is, put a value in the monad.*)
  val return: 'a -> 'a m
