A few examples of short programs written using OCaml Batteries Included.

Directory tools/ contains small tools.
Directory snippets/ contains random code extracts.
Directory euler/ contains solution programs to varous eulerproject.com puzzles
Directory pleac/ contains the start of a PLEAC for batteries

To build all these programs, install batteries and run

    make

from each directory.  If this doesn't work, steal the makefile, _tags
and myocamlbuild from another example directory, make them work for
the files in the new directory and send us the patch.  :) Extra points
for implementing a toplevel `make examples` that makes the examples.
