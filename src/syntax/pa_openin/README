This package implements a Camlp4 syntax extension for Objective Caml.
It adds the syntactic construction

    open M in e

that can appear in any context where an expression is expected (except
as a toplevel phrase). M is an arbitrary module expression (not only
qualified names as for usual open statements).

There is also a more general construction

   struct ... end in e

where ... is a sequence of structure item (type, exception, class,
open,... declarations).


To compile the syntax extension:
  ocamlfind ocamlc -pp camlp4oof -package camlp4 -c pa_openin.ml

To use the syntax extension:
  ocamlc -c -pp 'camlp4o pa_openin.cmo' myfile.ml

In the toplevel:
  ocaml camlp4o.cma pa_openin.cmo

The code is in the public domain. This version works with OCaml 3.10.
