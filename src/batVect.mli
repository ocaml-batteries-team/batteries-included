(** Extensible vectors with constant-time append/prepend.

    This module implements extensible arrays which work very much like ropes
    as described in
    {b Boehm, H., Atkinson, R., and Plass, M.} 1995. {e Ropes: an alternative to
    strings.}  Softw. Pract. Exper. 25, 12 (Dec. 1995), 1315-1330.

    These vectors have some interesting properties:
    - lower space overhead than other structures based on balanced trees such as Vec.
    The overhead can be adjusted, allowing to make get faster at the expense of set
    and viceversa.
    - appending or prepending a small vector to an arbitrarily large one in amortized
    constant time
    - concat, substring, insert, remove operations in amortized logarithmic time
    - access to and modification of vectors in logarithmic time

    {8 Functional nature and persistence}

    All operations but [destructive_set] (provided for efficient ephemeral usage)
    are non-destructive: the original vect is never modified.  When a new vect is
    returned as the result of an operation, it will share as much data as possible
    with its "parent". For instance, if a vect of length [n] undergoes [m]
    operations (assume [n >> m]) like set, append or prepend, the modified vector
    will only require [O(m)] space in addition to that taken by the original vect.

    However, Vect is an amortized data structure, and its use in a persistent setting
    can easily degrade its amortized time bounds. It is thus mainly intended to be used
    ephemerally. In some cases, it is possible to use Vect persistently with the same
    amortized bounds by explicitly rebalancing vects to be reused using [balance].
    Special care must be taken to avoid calling [balance] too frequently; in the limit,
    calling [balance] after each modification would defeat the purpose of amortization.

    This module is not thread-safe.

(** [filter f v] returns a vect with the elements [x] from [v] such that
    [f x] returns [true]. Operates in [O(n)] time. *)

val filter_map : ('a -> 'b option) -> 'a t -> 'b t
(** [filter_map f e] returns a vect consisting of all elements
	[x] such that [f y] returns [Some x] , where [y] is an element
	of [e]. *)

val find_all : ('a -> bool) -> 'a t -> 'a t
(** [find_all] is another name for {!Vect.filter}. *)

val partition : ('a -> bool) -> 'a t -> 'a t * 'a t
(** [partition p v] returns a pair of vects [(v1, v2)], where
    [v1] is the vect of all the elements of [v] that
    satisfy the predicate [p], and [v2] is the vect of all the
    elements of [v] that do not satisfy [p].
    The order of the elements in the input vect is preserved. *)

val first : 'a t -> 'a
val last : 'a t -> 'a
(** These return the first and last values in the vector *)
val shift : 'a t -> 'a * 'a t
(** Return the first element of a vector and its last [n-1] elements. *)
val pop : 'a t -> 'a * 'a t
(** Return the last element of a vector and its first [n-1] elements. *)
