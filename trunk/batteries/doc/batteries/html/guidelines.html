<center><h1>Writing code with OCaml Batteries Included</h1></center>
<p>
In this chapter, we attempt to document best practices for writing code
with OCaml Batteries Included. These best practices are bound to change
with time, so don't hesitate to visit this page regularly and/or to submit
rules.
</p>
<center><h2>Setting up your project</h2></center>
<p>
There are many ways of setting up a new project to use OCaml Batteries Included.
A few possibilities are documented <a href="setup.html">here</a>. The easiest
manner is generally to use OCamlBuild.
</p>
<center><h2>General guidelines</h2></center>
<center><h3>Be simple</h3></center>
<p>

</p>
<p>
OCaml is a multi-paradigm language. Out of the box, it features
functional programming, imperative programming, object-oriented
programming, concurrent programming and the often-overlooked stream
programming. Extensions of OCaml add several distributed programming
paradigms (JoCaml, Acute, BSML), safe dynamic programming (GCaml,
coca-ml) or document processing (OCamlDuce). This makes the OCaml
family an extremely powerful and versatile set of languages. This also
gives many ways of writing confusing (and possibly unsafe) code by
mixing a little bit too many styles. It is therefore generally a good
idea to keep distinct paradigms local. In other words, don't hesitate
to write object-oriented code but unless your whole project is
object-oriented, try to keep object-orientation local to a module and,
if you're writing a library, don't force your users to understand
OCaml's take on object-oriented programming to use your library.

<center><h2>Data structures</h2></center>
<p>
No matter what type of algorithm you intend to implement, you will
need data structures. While you will regularly need to implement your
own data, OCaml Batteries Included provides numerous data structures,
with which you should try to be familiar. Essentially, these data
structures can be classified as either
</p>
<dl>
 <dt>Persistent</dt> <dd>Lists, hash maps...</dd>
 <dt>Mutable</dt>    <dd>Arrays, references, hash tables, doubly-linked lists...</dd>
 <dt>Infinite</dt>   <dd>Streams, enumerations, inputs, outputs...</dd>
</dl>

<center><h3>Numeric data structures</h3></center>
<center><h3></h3></center>
<center><h2>Input and output</h2></center>
<center><h2>Printing</h2></center>
<center><h2>Naming conventions</h2></center>
<p>
The usual naming conventions for OCaml apply. 
</p>
<center><h3>Values</h3></center>
<dl>
  <dt>Values</dt> <dd>The name of a value should be written entirely in lower-case.
    If the name consists in several words, these words should be separated by an underscore.
    <pre>
      (**This function computes a matrix*)
      val compute_matrix : unit -> 'a array array
    </pre>
    Public functions which serve for conversion to/from another data structure should be
    called respectively <code>to_name_of_the_other_data_structure</code> and
    <code>from_name_of_the_other_data_structure</code>. An exception is conversion to
    enumerations, in which case the name of the function is simply <code>enum</code>.
