    This is a polymorphic multi-map, i.e. an association from 1 to many.

type ('a, 'b) t

val empty : ('a, 'b) t
(** The empty map, using [compare] as comparison function for both keys and values. *)

val is_empty : ('a, 'b) t -> bool
(** returns true if the map is empty. *)

val create : ('a -> 'a -> int) -> ('b -> 'b -> int) -> ('a, 'b) t
(** [create kcomp vcomp] creates a new empty map, 
    using kcomp for key comparison and vcomp for value comparison.*)

val add : 'a -> 'b -> ('a, 'b) t -> ('a, 'b) t
(** [add x y m] returns a map containing the same bindings as
    [m], plus a binding of [x] to [y].*)

val find : 'a -> ('a, 'b) t -> 'b BatSet.PSet.t
(** [find x m] returns the current binding of [x] in [m]*)

val remove_all : 'a -> ('a, 'b) t -> ('a, 'b) t
(** [remove_all x m] returns a map containing the same bindings as
    [m], except for [x] which is unbound in the returned map. *)

val remove : 'a -> 'b -> ('a, 'b) t -> ('a, 'b) t
(** [remove k d m] returns a map containing the same bindings as
    [m], except for [k] which is not bound to [d] anymore in the returned
    map. If [k] was not bound to [d], nothing is changed. If the operation
    removes the last binding of [k], then [k] is also removed from the set
    of keys.*)

val mem : 'a -> ('a, 'b) t -> bool
(** [mem x m] returns [true] if [m] contains at least a binding for [x],
    and [false] otherwise. *)

val iter : ('a -> 'b BatSet.PSet.t-> unit) -> ('a, 'b) t -> unit
(** [iter f m] applies [f] to all bindings in map [m].
    [f] receives the key as first argument, and the associated value
    as second argument. The order in which the bindings are passed to
    [f] is unspecified. Only current bindings are presented to [f]:
    bindings hidden by more recent bindings are not passed to [f]. *)

val map : ('b BatSet.PSet.t -> 'c BatSet.PSet.t) -> (('b -> 'b -> int) -> ('c -> 'c -> int)) -> ('a, 'b) t -> ('a, 'c) t
(** [map f vcompgen m] returns a map with same domain as [m], where the
    associated value [a] of all bindings of [m] has been
    replaced by the result of the application of [f] to [a].
    The order in which the associated values are passed to [f]
    is unspecified.
    [vcompgen] will use the vcomp function provided to [m] as an 
    argument to generate a new value comparison function.

val mapi : ('a -> 'b BatSet.PSet.t -> 'c BatSet.PSet.t) -> (('b -> 'b -> int) -> ('c -> 'c -> int)) -> ('a, 'b) t -> ('a, 'c) t
(** Same as [map], but the function receives as arguments both the
    key and the associated value for each binding of the map. *)

val fold : ('b BatSet.PSet.t -> 'c -> 'c) -> ('a , 'b) t -> 'c -> 'c
(** [fold f m a] computes [(f kN dN ... (f k1 d1 (f k0 d0 a))...)],
    where [k0,k1..kN] are the keys of all bindings in [m],
    and [d0,d1..dN] are the associated data.
    The order in which the bindings are presented to [f] is
    unspecified. *)

val foldi : ('a -> 'b BatSet.PSet.t -> 'c -> 'c) -> ('a , 'b) t -> 'c -> 'c
(** Same as [fold], but the function receives as arguments both the
    key and the associated value for each binding of the map. *)

val modify : 'a -> ('b BatSet.PSet.t -> 'b BatSet.PSet.t) -> ('a, 'b) t -> ('a, 'b) t
(** [modify x f m] replaces the binding for [x] with [f] applied to
    these values.

    @since 2.1
    @raise Not_found is [x] is unbound in [m] *)

val modify_def :
  'b BatSet.PSet.t -> 'a -> ('b BatSet.PSet.t -> 'b BatSet.PSet.t) ->
  ('a, 'b) t -> ('a, 'b) t
(** [modify_def dfl x f m] performs as [modify x f m] but it adds
    [f dfl] in [m] instead of raising [Not_found] if [x] was unbound.

    @since 2.1 *)

val modify_opt:
  'a -> ('b BatSet.PSet.t option -> 'b BatSet.PSet.t option) ->
  ('a, 'b) t -> ('a, 'b) t
(** [modify_opt x f m] allows to modify the bindings for [k] in [m]
    or absence thereof.

    @since 2.1 *)

val enum : ('a, 'b) t -> ('a * 'b) BatEnum.t
(** creates an enumeration for this map. *)

val of_enum : ?keys:('a -> 'a -> int) -> ?data:('b -> 'b -> int) -> ('a * 'b) BatEnum.t -> ('a, 'b) t
(** creates a map from an enumeration, using the specified function
    for key comparison or [compare] by default. *)

(** Infix operators over a {!BatMultiPMap} *)
module Infix : sig
  val (-->) : ('a, 'b) t -> 'a -> 'b BatSet.PSet.t
  (** [map-->key] returns the current binding of [key] in [map].
      Equivalent to [find key map]. *)

  val (<--) : ('a, 'b) t -> 'a * 'b -> ('a, 'b) t
    (** [map<--(key, value)] returns a map containing the same bindings as
        [map], plus a binding of [key] to [value]. Equivalent to
