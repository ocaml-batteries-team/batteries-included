(** Parsing character strings.

    This module defines common functions for parsing character strings,
    encoded in Latin-1. These functions are meant to be used in conjunction
    with the {!ParserCo} module.

    {b Note} As ParserCo, this module is still very rough and needs testing.

   [advance c p] returns a new position advanced by one char. If [c] is '\r' or '\n',

   [{offset = p.offset + 1; line = p.line}].*)
