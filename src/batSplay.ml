  (* Didactic implementation note : why that ugly Obj module here? Why not
     use a reference or mutable record field instead? 
     
     This is due to the covariance of the Map interface
     (type (+'a) t). OCaml checks the internal definition to verify
     that the internal datatype is consistent with the variance
     annotation. Using a reference in the implementation of BatSplay
     would make the compiler reject the implementation, because
     reference types must be invariant.


     Following is an explanation of covariance and reference
     invariance, feel free to skip it if you already know.

         The idea of covariance for data structure is the following : if
         you have an ('a list), and a type 'b which is less specific than
         'a (a subtype, eg. with OCaml polymorphic variants or object
         types), you can at any type pretend that your list is
         a ('b list): if all 'a can be used as 'b, then all ('a list) can
         be used as ('b list).
         
           # type a = < f1 : int; f2 : float >;;
           # type b = < f1 : int >;;
           # let t : a = object method f1 = 1 method f2 = 2. end;;
           val t : a = <obj>
           # (t :> b);;
           - : b = <obj>
           # ([t] :> b list);;
           - : b list = [<obj>]
         
         But this is not true for ('a list ref), orelese I may locally
         consider it a ('b list) and mutate it to add an element of type
         'b in it, then observe it at type ('a list ref) again. This is
         unsound because the added 'b element won't behave correctly as
         a 'a.
         
           # let tref = ref [t];;
           # (tref :> b list ref);;
           Error: Type a list ref is not a subtype of b list ref 
           Type a = < f1 : int; f2 : float > is not compatible with type
             b = < f1 : int > 
           The second object type has no method f2
         
         Imagine I think I know better, and break the type safety.
         
           # let forced_tref = (Obj.magic tref : b list ref);;
         
         Then I can add a element of type b to the list :
         
           # forced_tref := object method f1 = 1 end :: !forced_tref;;
         
         But this is unsound as I can now look at tref again, at type
         (a list ref).
         
           # !tref;;
           - : a list = [<obj>; <obj>]
           # (List.hd !tref)#f2;;
           Segmentation fault
         
         So in general, reference types cannot be safely subtyped (note
         that Java has had a blatant flaw in its type system for years, as
         mutable Arrays were covariant). If we used a `ref` in the
         internal definition of BatSplay.t, the typer would reject the
         module (the interface claims its covariant, while it's
         invariant).
       
     In our case however, the mutation that actually happen (that are
     confined in the internal implementation of BatSplay) are soundly
     compatible with subtyping. Indeed, rebalancing never adds any
     element to the splay tree, it only reorders the element that were
     already there. There is therefore no risk of unsoudness due to
     forced covariance. However, we must be careful to ensure that all
     rebalancings keep the set of elements of the splay tree
     unchanged.

     We use the dirty Obj magic to use the (Map of (key * 'a) bst)
     constructor as a reference that the type checked would accept as
     invariant. Note that the mutations are therefore confined to the
     "top" of the structure, the balanced tree itself is purely
     functional, and that we must be careful to preserve the physical
     identity of maps if we want to do mutations. For example,
     
       rebalance ((fun m -> m) some_map)
     
     will mutate some_map, but

       rebelance ((fun (Map tr) -> Map tr) some_map)

     won't, as the boxing/unboxing of (tr) made a shallow copy of the
     Map constructor. This explains the (Map tr as m) pattern,

       let find k (Map tr as m) = ...

     which ensures that we retain the physical identity of the map, to
     be able to rebalance it in the implementation. On the contrary,

       let remove k (Map tr) = ...

     will not perform a rebalancing, and the rebalancing the result
     will not affect the initial parameter.

     PS : No list reference were harmed during the implementation of
     this module.
