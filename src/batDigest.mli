(** MD5 message digest.

   This module provides functions to compute 128-bit ``digests'' of
   arbitrary-length strings or files. The digests are of cryptographic
   quality: it is very hard, given a digest, to forge a string having
   that digest. The algorithm used is MD5.

    This module extends Stdlib's
    {{:http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/libref/Digest.html}Digest}
    module, go there for documentation on the rest of the functions
    and types.

val channel : input -> int -> Digest.t
(** If [len] is nonnegative, [Digest.channel ic len] reads [len]
   characters from channel [ic] and returns their digest, or raises
   [End_of_file] if end-of-file is reached before [len] characters
   are read.  If [len] is negative, [Digest.channel ic len] reads
   all characters from [ic] until end-of-file is reached and return
   their digest.

    {b Note} This version of [channel] is currently very inefficient
    if [len] < 0 and requires copying the whole input to a temporary
    file.
