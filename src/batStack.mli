(** Last-in first-out stacks.

    This module implements stacks (LIFOs), with in-place modification.

*)

type 'a t = 'a Stack.t
(** The type of stacks containing elements of type ['a]. *)

exception Empty
(** Raised when {!Stack.pop} or {!Stack.top} is applied to an empty stack. *)

val create : unit -> 'a t
(** Return a new stack, initially empty. *)

val push : 'a -> 'a t -> unit
(** [push x s] adds the element [x] at the top of stack [s]. *)

val pop : 'a t -> 'a
(** [pop s] removes and returns the topmost element in stack [s],
    or @raise Empty if the stack is empty. *)

val top : 'a t -> 'a
(** [top s] returns the topmost element in stack [s],
    or @raise Empty if the stack is empty. *)

val clear : 'a t -> unit
(** Discard all elements from a stack. *)

val copy : 'a t -> 'a t
(** Return a copy of the given stack. *)

val is_empty : 'a t -> bool
(** Return [true] if the given stack is empty, [false] otherwise. *)

val length : 'a t -> int
(** Return the number of elements in a stack. *)

val iter : ('a -> unit) -> 'a t -> unit
(** [iter f s] applies [f] in turn to all elements of [s],
    from the element at the top of the stack to the element at the
    bottom of the stack. The stack itself is unchanged. *)


include BatGen.Enumerable with type 'a enumerable = 'a t

val gen : 'a t -> 'a BatGen.t
(** [gen s] returns an generation of the elements of stack [s], from
    the most recently entered to the least recently entered.  This
    generation is made on a copy of the input stack, and reading from
    it will not affect [s].  *)

val gen_destruct : 'a t -> 'a BatGen.t
(** [gen s] returns a destructive generation of the elements of
    stack [s], from the most recently entered to the least recently
    entered.  Reading the generation will progressively empty [s].*)

val of_gen : 'a BatGen.t -> 'a t
(** [of_gen e] returns a new stack containing all the elements of
    [e].  This is equivalent to calling [push] with the first element
    of the generation, then with the second, etc.

    Note: if [s] is a stack, [s <> of_gen (gen s)], as [of_gen]
    reverses the input order.  *)

(** {6 Boilerplate code}*)

(** {7 Printing}*)

(* Prints the contents of the given stack *)
val print : ?first:string -> ?last:string -> ?sep:string -> ('a BatInnerIO.output -> 'b -> unit) ->  'a BatInnerIO.output -> 'b t -> unit

(* Comparison and equality tests can be constructed based on a
   comparison or equality function for elements. *)
val compare : 'a BatOrd.comp -> 'a t BatOrd.comp
val equal : 'a BatOrd.eq -> 'a t BatOrd.eq

  val top : 'a t -> 'a option
  val pop : 'a t -> 'a option
