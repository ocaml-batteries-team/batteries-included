(**
   This module implements a generic finger tree datastructure
   as described here:
   Finger Trees: A Simple General-purpose Data Structure
   http://www.soi.city.ac.uk/~ross/papers/FingerTree.pdf

   The finger tree itself is functorized over the measure
   (so monomorphic over the measure) and polymorphic over the
   measurement function (because there are useful measurements
   functions that are polymorphic over the elements being measured).

   This module also contains an instanciation of a finger tree that
   implements a functional sequence with the following characteristics:
   - amortized constant time addition and deletions at both ends
   - contant time size operation
   - logarithmic lookup, update or deletion of the element at a given index
   - logarithmic splitting and concatenation

   If you are trying to understand the signature at first, whenever you
   see a type [(something, _, _) wrap], just pretend it is simply
   the type [something] (this is what the documentation does).

   Complexities are given assuming that the monoid combination operation
   and the measurement functions are constant time and space.
*)

(** The type of the element of a monoid. *)
type 'a monoid = {
  zero : 'a; (** The neutral element of the monoid. *)
  combine : 'a -> 'a -> 'a ; (** [combine] should be associative, and have [zero] as neutral element. *)
}

exception Empty
(** An exception that is thrown by various operations when
    trying to get a non existing element. *)

module type S =
sig

  type 'm m
  type ('a, 'm) fg
  (** The type of finger trees containing elements of type ['a]
      measured with the type [measure]. *)

  type ('wrapped_type, 'a, 'm) wrap
  (** A type meant to avoid duplication of signatures.

      For the generic finger tree, this type will
      be [monoid:'m monoid -> measure:('a -> 'm) -> 'wrapped_type].

      Once the functor has been applied, the resulting module should
      be reexported in such a way that the type is now simply
      ['wrapped_type].
