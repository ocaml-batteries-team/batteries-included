(** MD5 message digest.

   This module provides functions to compute 128-bit ``digests'' of
   arbitrary-length strings or files. The digests are of cryptographic
   quality: it is very hard, given a digest, to forge a string having
   that digest. The algorithm used is MD5.

type t = string
(** The type of digests: 16-character strings. *)

val string : string -> t
(** Return the digest of the given string. *)

val substring : string -> int -> int -> t
(** [Digest.substring s ofs len] returns the digest of the substring
   of [s] starting at character number [ofs] and containing [len]
   characters. *)

val file : string -> t
(** Return the digest of the file whose name is given. *)

val to_hex : t -> string
(** Return the printable hexadecimal representation of the given digest. *)

val from_hex : string -> t
(** Convert a hexadecimal representation back into the corresponding digest.
   @raise Invalid_argument if the argument is not exactly 32 hexadecimal
   characters.
   @since 4.00.0 *)

val channel : input -> int -> Digest.t
(** If [len] is nonnegative, [Digest.channel ic len] reads [len]
   characters from channel [ic] and returns their digest, or
   @raise End_of_file if end-of-file is reached before [len] characters
   are read.  If [len] is negative, [Digest.channel ic len] reads
   all characters from [ic] until end-of-file is reached and return
   their digest.

    {b Note} This version of [channel] is currently very inefficient
    if [len] < 0 and requires copying the whole input to a temporary
    file.

val output : 'a output -> t -> unit
(** Write a digest on the given output. *)

val print : 'a output -> Digest.t -> unit
(** Write a digest on the given output in hexadecimal. *)

val input : input -> Digest.t
(** Read a digest from the given input. *)

val compare : t -> t -> int
(** The comparison function for 16-character digest, with the same
    specification as {!Pervasives.compare} and the implementation
    shared with {!String.compare}. Along with the type [t], this
    function [compare] allows the module [Digest] to be passed as
    argument to the functors {!Set.Make} and {!Map.Make}.
