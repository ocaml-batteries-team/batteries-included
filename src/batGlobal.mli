(** Mutable global variable.

    Often in OCaml you want to have a global variable, which is mutable
    and uninitialized when declared. You can use a ['a option ref] but
    this is not very convenient. The Global module provides functions
    to easily create and manipulate such variables.

type 'a t
(** Abstract type of a global *)

exception Global_not_initialized of string
(** Raised when a global variable is accessed without first having been
 assigned a value. The parameter contains the name of the global. *)

val empty : string -> 'a t
(** Returns an new named empty global. The name of the global can be any
 string. It identifies the global and makes debugging easier. *)

val name : 'a t -> string
(** Retrieve the name of a global. *)

val set : 'a t -> 'a -> unit
(** Set the global value contents. *)

val get : 'a t -> 'a
(** Get the global value contents - raise Global_not_initialized if not
 defined. *)

val undef : 'a t -> unit
(** Reset the global value contents to undefined. *)

val isdef : 'a t -> bool
  (** Return [true] if the global value has been set. *)

val opt : 'a t -> 'a option
  (** Return [None] if the global is undefined, else [Some v] where v is the
  current global value contents. *)
