type 'a uref
  (** A [t uref] is a reference to a cell that contains a
      value of type [t]. *)

type 'a t = 'a uref
  (** A synonym for convenience *)

val uref : 'a -> 'a uref
  (** [uref x] allocates a new uref and places the value [x] in it. *)

val uget : 'a uref -> 'a
  (** [uget ur] returns the value stored in the uref [ur]. *)

val uset : 'a uref -> 'a -> unit
  (** [uset ur x] updates the contents of [ur] with [x]. *)

val unite : ?sel:('a -> 'a -> 'a) -> 'a uref -> 'a uref -> unit
  (** [unite ~sel ur1 ur2] unites the urefs [ur1] and [ur2], selecting
      the result of [sel (uget ur1) (uget ur2)] for the contents of
      the resulting united uref. After this operation, [uget ur1 ==
      uget ur2]. By default, [sel] is {!fst}. *)

val equal : 'a uref -> 'a uref -> bool
  (** [equal ur1 ur2] returns [true] iff [ur1] and [ur2] are equal
      urefs, either because they are physically the same or because
      they have been {!unite}d. *)

(** {6 Printing} *)

val print : ('a BatInnerIO.output -> 'b -> unit)
  -> 'a BatInnerIO.output -> 'b uref -> unit
  (** Print the uref. *)
