(** The data structure for a manual cache with keys ['a] and values ['b].

    This cache gives access to some internals of a memoized function
    [f], called the generating function.  This function is usually
    pure; always returning the same output for a given input.  This
    module allows the results of complex functions to be cached so
    that the function does not need to be called again to get that
    result.

    When [c.get k] is called, an internal structure is first consulted to
    see if [f k] has been stored in that structure.  If it has, then
    that previous result is returned, otherwise, [f k] is evaluated,
    the result stored in the caching structure and also returned to
    the user.

    The user is allowed to remove a value from the caching structure
    with [c.del k].  This allows the user to prevent unbounded growth
    of the cache by removing unneeded entries.  If the user prefers an
    automatically managed cache, this module provides [!auto_cache].

    Last, [c.gen ()] will enumerate all the currently memorized
    bindings as pairs.  This allows inspection of what is currently
    cached.

    hashtable is [~init_size]. The hashtable uses the polymorphic
    [hash] and [(=)].*)


val make_map : gen:('a -> 'b) -> ('a,'b) manual_cache
(** Make a manual cache for function [~gen] backed by a Set.t.  This
    set uses the polymorphic [(<)] for comparison, so ['a] should be
    properly comparable by it. *)

(** Automatically managed caches

    This type of cache is more transparent than the [!manual_cache]
    above.  It does not provide inspection of the caching structure,
    but guarantees bounded memory usage through some policy of
    discarding some entries.

    Each auto-cache can have a different policy to decide which entry
    to discard.

     added to the cache, if its capacity was [cap], then the least

     it. *)
