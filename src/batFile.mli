val lines_of : string -> string BatEnum.t
(** [line_of name] reads the contents of file [name] as an enumeration of lines.
    The file is automatically closed once the last line has been reached or the
    enumeration is closed or garbage-collected. *)

val write_lines: string -> string BatEnum.t -> unit
(** [write_lines name lines] writes strings given by [lines] to file [name] with newline character appended to each line. *)

val size_of: string -> int
(** [size_of name] returns the size of file [name] in bytes.*)

val size_of_big: string -> Int64.t
(** [size_of_big name] returns the size of file [name] in bytes, as a 64-bit integer.

    This function is provided as the size of a file larger than 1 Gb cannot
    be represented with an [int] on a 32-bit machine.*)

(** {6 File permissions}

    File permissions are used when creating a file to allow controlling which users
    may read, write or open that file. To use a permission, create a value of type
    {!permission} and pass it as argument to {!open_in}, {!open_out}, {!with_file_in} or
    {!with_file_out}.
