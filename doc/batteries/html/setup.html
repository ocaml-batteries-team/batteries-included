<center><h1>Installing Batteries Included</h1></center>
<center><h2>The GODI package manager</h2></center>
<p>
At the moment, on most computers, the easiest manner of installing
OCaml Batteries Included on your computer is to take advantage
of <a href="http://godi.camlcity.org/godi/index.html">GODI
</a>, a package manager specifically dedicated to OCaml. You will
first need to install GODI, if GODI isn't install on your machine yet,
then to select package <code>batteries</code> in the list of packages
and accept the decisions of GODI. This should take care of installing
OCaml Batteries Included for you.
</p>
<p>
Note that producing the documentation is long (typically 10-15 minutes).
</p>

<center><h2>Fedora / Debian / Red Hat / Ubuntu</h2></center>
<center>At the time of this writing, this method is experimental.</center>
<p>
On Fedora / Debian / Red Hat / Ubuntu stations,
packages <emph>may</emph> be able for Batteries. If this is the case,
to install OCaml Batteries Included, just run your usual package
manager (generally either Synaptic, Yum, KPackage, Aptitude or
DSelect), and select package <code>libbatteries-ocaml-dev</code>.
This should take care of installing OCaml Batteries Included for you.
</p>

<center><h2>Manually</h2></center>
<p>
To perform installation of OCaml Batteries Included manually, please make sure
that you have already installed all the following tools and libraries:
</p>
<ul>
<li>OCaml itself</li>
<li>Findlib</li>
<li>Camomile, version 0.7 or greater</li>
<li>GNU Make</li>
<li>OUnit (optional, to run tests)</li>
<li>Ocaml-benchmark (optional, to run benchmarks)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Once all these libraries are installed, you may download and
uncompress the latest version of OCaml Batteries Included, enter the
directory produced by decompression and invoke
<pre>
make all install doc install-doc
</pre>
to build and install both the byte-code version, the native version
and the documentation of OCaml Batteries Included. 
</p>

<center><h1>Using Batteries Included</h1></center>
<center><h2>Interactive environment</h2></center> 

To use batteries in the ocaml toplevel, install <code>ocamlinit</code>
from the batteries source directory into your <code>~/.ocamlinit</code> 
file and launch ocaml normally,<br />

<code>
ocaml
</code>,
or, if you have <code>rlwrap</code> installed,
<code>
rlwrap ocaml
</code>, for more comfortable editing.

<!--
<center><h2>Compiling with batteries (easiest technique)</h2></center>
OCaml Batteries Included also provides drop-in replacement for
OCamlBuild, the standard tool used to compile complete projects.
<br />
<dl>
 <dt>Bytecode compilation</dt><dd>To compile a file called <code>date.ml</code> and all the files it requires
 to bytecode, invoke <ocde>ocamlfind batteries/ocamlbuild date.byte</code>.</dd>
 <dt>Optimized compilation</dt><dd>To compile a file called <code>date.ml</code> and all the files it requires
 to an optimized native binary, invoke <ocde>ocamlfind batteries/ocamlbuild date.native</code>.</dd>
</dl>
-->

For more informations on OCamlBuild, you may read <a href="http://nicolaspouillard.fr/ocamlbuild/ocamlbuild-user-guide.html">the official documentation</a>.

<center><h2>More control</h2></center>
File <a href="../myocamlbuild"><code>doc/batteries/myocamlbuild.ml</code></a>
is an extension of OCamlBuild. It defines <emph>tags</emph>, which you
may use in your projects to specify that your project should take
advantage of the various features of Batteries Included. Copying this
file to your project directory is required to take advantage of these
tags.
<br />
The tags defined by Batteries Included are:
<dl>
<dt>use_batteries</dt> <dd>Use Batteries Included both as a library and to extend the OCaml language.</dd>
<dt>use_batteries_r</dt> <dd>Use Batteries Included both as a library and to extend the OCaml language -- in revised syntax.</dd>
<dt>pkg_threads</dt><dd>Allow threading. Required to use module <code>Control.Concurrency.Threads</code>.</dd>
<dt>pkg_batteries</dt> <dd>Use Batteries Included only as a
    library. No language extension is involved.  To use the features
    of Batteries Included with <code>pkg_batteries</code>, you need to start your
    files with <code>open Batteries</code>.</dd>
<dt>use_boilerplate</dt> <dd>Use only the syntax extensions necessary
    to automatically generate boiler-plate code. These syntax extensions are
    not added by default when performing <code>use_batteries</code> as they can suddenly
    turn correct code into something which doesn't compile. Use tag
    <code>use_boilerplate</code> in conjunction with either <code>use_batteries</code> or
    <code>use_batteries_r</code>.</dd>
</dl>

To take advantage of a tag for a file or a set of files, you need to add this
tag to a speciale file named <code>_tags</code>, placed in the same directory
as your files. For instance, to have <code>my_file.ml</code> compiled with
Batteries Included as a library and <code>my_other_file.ml</code> compiled
with both the library, the language extensions and boiler-plate code, your
file <code>_tags</code> should read:
<pre>
&lt;my_file.ml&gt;: pkg_batteries
&lt;my_other_file.ml&gt;: use_batteries,use_boilerplate
</pre>

The order of lines doesn't matter, nor does the order of tags on one line. For
more informations on <code>myocamlbuild.ml</code> and <code>_tags</code>, see
<a href="http://brion.inria.fr/gallium/index.php/Ocamlbuild">the documentation
of OCamlBuild</a>.

<center><h2>Even more control</h2></center> During its installation,
Batteries Included creates a set
of <a href="http://projects.camlcity.org/projects/findlib.html">findlib</a>
packages:

<dl>
<dt>batteries</dt> <dd>
The main package for Batteries Included. In turn, this package defines subpackages
<!--
   <dt>batteries.pa_openin.syntax</dt> <dd>A language extension adding new possibilities for the opening of modules.</dd>
   <dt>batteries.pa_type_conv.syntax</dt> <dd>A language extension adding boiler-plate possibilities.</dd>
   <dt>batteries.pa_where.syntax</dt> <dd>A language extension adding a construction <code>where</code> dual to <code>let</code>.</dd>
-->
   <dt>batteries.pa_batteries.syntax</dt> <dd>A language extension for automatically opening module <code>Batteries</code>.</dd>
   <dt>batteries.pa_comprehension.syntax</dt> <dd>A language extension for list comprehension.</dd>
   <dt>batteries.pa_string.syntax</dt> <dd>A language extension added the ability to declare and pattern-match against new kinds of strings.</dd>
</dd>
</dl>

For more information on how to use these packages, please see the documentation of
<a href="http://projects.camlcity.org/projects/findlib.html">findlib</a>.

<center><h2>Another method (using OMake)</h2></center>
Building a project with OMake is fairly simple.
You just need to take advantage of OMake's built-in findlib support by
adding the following to your OMakefile:
<code class="example">
<pre>
USE_OCAMLFIND = true

OCAMLPACKS[] +=
   batteries.pa_comprehension.syntax
   batteries.pa_string.syntax
   batteries

OCAMLDEPFLAGS += -syntax camlp4o
OCAMLFLAGS += -syntax camlp4o
</pre>
</code>


Here's a complete OMakefile for building the "cat" implementation you will
find under the examples/ subdirectory:

<code class="example">
<pre>
USE_OCAMLFIND = true

OCAMLPACKS[] += batteries

OCamlProgram(cat, cat)
</pre>
</code>


The above OCAMLPACKS definition uses Batteries and all the non-destructive
syntax extensions available as of 2008-11-16; this corresponds to the
<code>pkg_batteries</code> tag in ocamlbuild.

If you only want to use Batteries as a library, without syntax extensions, use

<code class="example">
<pre>
OCAMLPACKS[] += batteries
</pre>
</code>


and drop the <code>OCAMLDEPFLAGS</code> and <code>OCAMLFLAGS</code>
lines in the above examples, as they are no longer needed.
