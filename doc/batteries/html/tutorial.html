<h1>Starting with OCaml Batteries Included</h1>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>
Several methods exist for installing OCaml Batteries Included:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="tutorial_godi.html">The GODI package manager</a> is rather complicated to install for the first time
but is then quite simple to use. It works under any version of Unix, including
Linux, MacOS X, BSD, ...</li>
<li><a href="tutorial_make.html">Doing it by hand</a> is quite easy to get started, but you probably want some real package management in the long run.</li>
<li>Batteries and OCaml can be installed with the <a href="https://github.com/hcarty/ocamlbrew">ocamlbrew</a> tool, this will work in fewer environments but should be easier than GODI in the environments it works in.</li>
</ul>
