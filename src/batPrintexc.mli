val pass : ('a -> 'b) -> 'a -> 'b
(** [Printexc.pass fn x] applies [fn] to [x] and returns the result.
    If the evaluation of [fn x] raises any exception, the
    name of the exception is printed on standard error output,
    and the exception is raised again.
    The typical use is to catch and report exceptions that
    escape a function application. *)

val print : _ BatInnerIO.output -> exn -> unit
(** Print an exception.*)

val print_backtrace: _ BatInnerIO.output -> unit
(** [print_backtrace oc] Prints the an exception backtrace on the output channel [oc].
    @since 1.4.0
