(** Simple lexing using ocaml conventions

    This module extends Stdlib's
    {{:http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/libref/Lexing.html}Lexing}
    module, go there for documentation on the rest of the functions
    and types.

(** {6 Positions} *)

type position = Lexing.position = {
  pos_fname : string;
  pos_lnum : int;
  pos_bol : int;
  pos_cnum : int;
}
(** A value of type [position] describes a point in a source file.
    [pos_fname] is the file name; [pos_lnum] is the line number;
    [pos_bol] is the offset of the beginning of the line (number
    of characters between the beginning of the file and the beginning
    of the line); [pos_cnum] is the offset of the position (number of
    characters between the beginning of the file and the position).

    See the documentation of type [lexbuf] for information about
    how the lexing engine will manage positions.
*)

val dummy_pos : position;;
(** A value of type [position], guaranteed to be different from any
    valid position.
*)


(** {6 Lexer buffers} *)


type lexbuf = Lexing.lexbuf =
  { refill_buff : lexbuf -> unit;
    mutable lex_buffer : Bytes.t;
    mutable lex_buffer_len : int;
    mutable lex_abs_pos : int;
    mutable lex_start_pos : int;
    mutable lex_curr_pos : int;
    mutable lex_last_pos : int;
    mutable lex_last_action : int;
    mutable lex_eof_reached : bool;
    mutable lex_mem : int array;
    mutable lex_start_p : position;
    mutable lex_curr_p : position;
  }
(** The type of lexer buffers. A lexer buffer is the argument passed
    to the scanning functions defined by the generated scanners.
    The lexer buffer holds the current state of the scanner, plus
    a function to refill the buffer from the input.

    At each token, the lexing engine will copy [lex_curr_p] to
    [lex_start_p], then change the [pos_cnum] field
    of [lex_curr_p] by updating it with the number of characters read
    since the start of the [lexbuf].  The other fields are left
    unchanged by the lexing engine.  In order to keep them
    accurate, they must be initialised before the first use of the
    lexbuf, and updated by the relevant lexer actions (i.e. at each
    end of line -- see also [new_line]).

    Note: Batteries does not currently support the ~with_positions:false
    mode available since OCaml 4.08 to disable position tracking. If you
    need this, please get in touch with the Batteries maintainers.

(** {6 Functions for lexer semantic actions} *)


(** The following functions can be called from the semantic actions
    of lexer definitions (the ML code enclosed in braces that
    computes the value returned by lexing functions). They give
    access to the character string matched by the regular expression
    associated with the semantic action. These functions must be
    applied to the argument [lexbuf], which, in the code generated by
    [ocamllex], is bound to the lexer buffer passed to the parsing
    function. *)

val lexeme : lexbuf -> string
(** [Lexing.lexeme lexbuf] returns the string matched by
           the regular expression. *)

val lexeme_char : lexbuf -> int -> char
(** [Lexing.lexeme_char lexbuf i] returns character number [i] in
    the matched string. *)

val lexeme_start : lexbuf -> int
(** [Lexing.lexeme_start lexbuf] returns the offset in the
    input stream of the first character of the matched string.
    The first character of the stream has offset 0. *)

val lexeme_end : lexbuf -> int
(** [Lexing.lexeme_end lexbuf] returns the offset in the input stream
    of the character following the last character of the matched
    string. The first character of the stream has offset 0. *)

val lexeme_start_p : lexbuf -> position
(** Like [lexeme_start], but return a complete [position] instead
    of an offset. *)

val lexeme_end_p : lexbuf -> position
(** Like [lexeme_end], but return a complete [position] instead
    of an offset. *)

val new_line : lexbuf -> unit
(** Update the [lex_curr_p] field of the lexbuf to reflect the start
    of a new line.  You can call this function in the semantic action
    of the rule that matches the end-of-line character.
    @since 3.11.0
*)

(** {6 Miscellaneous functions} *)

val flush_input : lexbuf -> unit
(** Discard the contents of the buffer and reset the current
    position to 0.  The next use of the lexbuf will trigger a
    refill. *)
