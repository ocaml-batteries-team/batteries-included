(**
   This module implements a generic finger tree datastructure
   as described here:
   Finger Trees: A Simple General-purpose Data Structure
   http://www.soi.city.ac.uk/~ross/papers/FingerTree.pdf

   The finger tree itself is polymorphic over the measure and
   the measurement function (this is needed because sometimes
   the type of the measure depends on the type of the elements).

   This module also contains an instanciation of a finger tree that
   implements a functional sequence with the following characteristics:
   - amortized constant time addition and deletions at both ends
   - contant time size operation
   - logarithmic lookup, update or deletion of the element at a given index
   - logarithmic splitting and concatenation

   If you are trying to understand the signature at first, whenever you
   see a type [(something, _, _) wrap], just pretend it is simply
   the type [something] (this is what the documentation does).

   Complexities are given assuming that the monoid combination operation
   and the measurement functions are constant time and space.

   None of the functions on finger trees can cause stack overflow:
   they use at worst a logarithmic amount of stack space.
*)

(** The type of the element of a monoid. *)
type 'a monoid = {
  zero : 'a; (** The neutral element of the monoid. *)
  combine : 'a -> 'a -> 'a ; (** [combine] should be associative, and have [zero] as neutral element. *)
}

exception Empty
(** An exception that is thrown by various operations when
    trying to get a non existing element. *)

module type S =
sig

  type ('a, 'm) fg
  (** The type of finger trees containing elements of type ['a]
      measured by ['m]. *)

  type ('wrapped_type, 'a, 'm) wrap
  (** A type meant to avoid duplication of signatures.

      For the generic finger tree, this type will
      be [monoid:'m monoid -> measure:('a -> 'm) -> 'wrapped_type].

      Once the finger tree has been specialized, the resulting module
      should be reexported in such a way that the type is now simply
      ['wrapped_type].
