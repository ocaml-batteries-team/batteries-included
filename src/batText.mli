(** Heavyweight strings ("ropes")

    This module implements ropes as described in
    Boehm, H., Atkinson, R., and Plass, M. 1995. Ropes: an alternative to
    strings. Softw. Pract. Exper. 25, 12 (Dec. 1995), 1315-1330.

    Ropes are an alternative to strings which support efficient operations:
    - determining the length of a rope in constant time
    - appending or prepending a small rope to an arbitrarily large one in amortized constant time
    - concat, substring, insert, remove operations in amortized logarithmic time
    - access to and modification of ropes in logarithmic time

    {8 Functional nature and persistence}

    All operations are non-destructive: the original rope is never modified. When a
    new rope is returned as the result of an operation, it will share as much data
    as possible with its "parent". For instance, if a rope of length [n] undergoes
    [m] operations (assume [n >> m]) like set, append or prepend, the modified
    rope will only require [O(m)] space in addition to that taken by the
    original one.

    However, Rope is an amortized data structure, and its use in a persistent setting
    can easily degrade its amortized time bounds. It is thus mainly intended to be used
    ephemerally. In some cases, it is possible to use Rope persistently with the same
    amortized bounds by explicitly rebalancing ropes to be reused using [balance].
    Special care must be taken to avoid calling [balance] too frequently; in the limit,
    calling [balance] after each modification would defeat the purpose of amortization.


    {8 Limitations}

    The length of ropes is limited to approximately 700 Mb on 32-bit
    architectures, 220 Gb on 64 bit architectures.

(** {6 Properties } *)

val is_empty : t -> bool

val balance : t -> t
(** [balance r] returns a balanced copy of the [r] rope. Note that ropes are
    automatically rebalanced when their height exceeds a given threshold, but
    [balance] allows to invoke that operation explicity. *)

(** {6 Operations } *)

val append : t -> t -> t
(** [append r u] concatenates the [r] and [u] ropes. In general, it operates
    in [O(log(min n1 n2))] amortized time.
    Small ropes are treated specially and can be appended/prepended in
    amortized [O(1)] time. *)

val ( ^^^ ): t -> t -> t
(** As {!append}*)

val append_char : BatUChar.t -> t -> t
(** [append_char c r] returns a new rope with the [c] character at the end
    in amortized [O(1)] time. *)

val prepend_char : BatUChar.t -> t -> t
(** [prepend_char c r] returns a new rope with the [c] character at the
    beginning in amortized [O(1)] time. *)

val get : t -> int -> BatUChar.t
(** [get r n] returns the (n+1)th character from the rope [r]; i.e.
    [get r 0] returns the first character.

    @raise Out_of_bounds if a character out of bounds is requested.
*)

val set : t -> int -> BatUChar.t -> t
(** [set r n c] returns a copy of rope [r]  where the (n+1)th character
    has been set to [c]. See also {!get}.
    Operates in worst-case [O(log size)] time. *)

val sub : t -> int -> int -> t
(** [sub r m n] returns a sub-rope of [r] containing all characters
    whose indexes range from [m] to [m + n - 1] (included).
    Operates in worst-case [O(log size)] time.

    @raise Out_of_bounds in the same cases as sub.
*)

val insert : int -> t -> t -> t
(** [insert n r u] returns a copy of the [u] rope where [r] has been
    inserted between the characters with index [n] and [n + 1] in the
    original rope. The length of the new rope is
    [length u + length r].
    Operates in amortized [O(log(size r) + log(size u))] time. *)

val remove : int -> int -> t -> t
(** [remove m n r] returns the rope resulting from deleting the
    characters with indexes ranging from [m] to [m + n - 1] (included)
    from the original rope [r]. The length of the new rope is
    [length r - n].
    Operates in amortized [O(log(size r))] time. *)

val concat : t -> t list -> t
(** [concat sep sl] concatenates the list of ropes [sl],
    inserting the separator rope [sep] between each. *)


(** {6 Iteration} *)

val iter : (BatUChar.t -> unit) -> t -> unit
(** [iter f r] applies [f] to all the characters in the [r] rope,
    in order. *)

val iteri : ?base:int -> (int -> BatUChar.t -> unit) -> t -> unit
(** Operates like [iter], but also passes the index of the character
    to the given function. *)

val range_iter : (BatUChar.t -> unit) -> int -> int -> t -> unit
(** [range_iter f m n r] applies [f] to all the characters whose
    indices [k] satisfy [m] <= [k] < [m + n].
    It is thus equivalent to [iter f (sub m n r)], but does not
    create an intermediary rope. [range_iter] operates in worst-case
    [O(n + log m)] time, which improves on the [O(n log m)] bound
    from an explicit loop using [get].

    @raise Out_of_bounds in the same cases as [sub].
*)

val range_iteri :
  (int -> BatUChar.t -> unit) -> ?base:int -> int -> int -> t -> unit
(** As [range_iter], but passes base + index of the character in the
    subrope defined by next to arguments. *)

val fold : ('a -> BatUChar.t -> 'a ) -> 'a -> t -> 'a
(** [Rope.fold f a r] computes [ f (... (f (f a r0) r1)...) rN-1 ]
    where [rn = Rope.get n r ] and [N = length r]. *)

(** [init l f] returns the rope of length [l] with the chars f 0 , f
    1 , f 2 ... f (l-1). *)

val filter_map : (BatUChar.t -> BatUChar.t option) -> t -> t
(** [filter_map f l] calls [(f a0) (f a1).... (f an)] where [a0..an] are
    the characters of [l]. It returns the list of elements [bi] such as
    [f ai = Some bi] (when [f] returns [None], the corresponding element of
    [l] is discarded). *)

val filter : (BatUChar.t -> bool) -> t -> t
(** [filter f s] returns a copy of rope [s] in which only
    characters [c] such that [f c = true] remain.*)

*)

(** [Rope.rindex s c] returns the position of the rightmost
    occurrence of character [c] in rope [s].

    @raise Not_found if [c] does not occur in [s].
*)

val rindex_from : t -> int -> BatUChar.t -> int
(** Same as {!rindex}, but start
    searching at the character position given as second argument.
    [rindex s c] is equivalent to
    [rindex_from s (length s - 1) c]. *)

val contains : t -> BatUChar.t -> bool
(** [contains s c] tests if character [c]
    appears in the rope [s]. *)

val contains_from : t -> int -> BatUChar.t -> bool
(** [contains_from s start c] tests if character [c] appears in

(** [rcontains_from s stop c] tests if character [c]
    appears in the subrope of [s] starting from the beginning
    of [s] to index [stop] (included).
    @raise Out_of_bounds if [stop] is not a valid index of [s]. *)

val find : t -> t -> int
(** [find s x] returns the starting index of the first occurrence of
    rope [x] within rope [s].

    {b Note} This implementation is optimized for short ropes.

    @raise Not_found if [x] is not a subrope of [s]. *)

val find_from : t -> int -> t -> int
(** [find_from s ofs x] behaves as [find s x] but starts searching
    at offset [ofs]. [find s x] is equivalent to [find_from s 0 x].

    @raise Out_of_bounds if [ofs] is not a valid_position in [s].
    @raise Not_found if [x] is not a subrope of [s].
*)

val rfind : t -> t -> int
(** [rfind s x] returns the starting index of the last occurrence
    of rope [x] within rope [s].

(** [rfind_from s ofs x] behaves as [rfind s x] but starts searching

    @raise Out_of_bounds if [ofs] is not a valid_position in [s].
    @raise Not_found if [x] is not a subrope of [s].
*)


val starts_with : t -> t -> bool
(** [starts_with s x] returns [true] if [s] is starting with [x], [false] otherwise. *)

val ends_with : t -> t -> bool
(** [ends_with s x] returns [true] if the rope [s] is ending with [x], [false] otherwise. *)

val exists : t -> t -> bool
(** [exists str sub] returns true if [sub] is a subrope of [str] or
    false otherwise. *)

val left : t -> int -> t
(**[left r len] returns the rope containing the [len] first characters of [r]*)

val head : t -> int -> t
(**as {!left}*)

val tail : t -> int -> t

val strip : ?chars:(BatUChar.t list) -> t -> t
(** Returns the rope without the chars if they are at the beginning or
    at the end of the rope. By default chars are " \t\r\n". *)

val lchop : t -> t
(** Returns the same rope but without the first character.
    does nothing if the rope is empty. *)

val rchop : t -> t
(** Returns the same rope but without the last character.
    does nothing if the rope is empty. *)

val slice : ?first:int -> ?last:int -> t -> t
(** [slice ?first ?last s] returns a "slice" of the rope
    which corresponds to the characters [s.[first]],
    [s.[first+1]], ..., [s[last-1]]. Note that the character at
    index [last] is {b not} included! If [first] is omitted it
    defaults to the start of the rope, i.e. index 0, and if
    [last] is omitted is defaults to point just past the end of
    [s], i.e. [length s].  Thus, [slice s] is equivalent to
    [copy s].

    Negative indexes are interpreted as counting from the end of
    the rope. For example, [slice ~last:-2 s] will return the
    rope [s], but without the last two characters.

    This function {b never} raises any exceptions. If the
    indexes are out of bounds they are automatically clipped.
*)

val splice : t -> int -> int -> t -> t

val fill : t -> int -> int -> BatUChar.t -> t
(** [fill s start len c] returns the rope in which
    characters number [start] to [start + len - 1] of [s] has
    been replaced by [c].

    @raise Invalid_argument if [start] and [len] do not
    designate a valid subrope of [s]. *)

val blit : t -> int -> t -> int -> int -> t
(** [blit src srcoff dst dstoff len] returns a copy
    of [dst] in which [len] characters have been copied
    from rope [src], starting at character number [srcoff], to
    rope [dst], starting at character number [dstoff]. It works
    correctly even if [src] and [dst] are the same rope,
    and the source and destination chunks overlap.

    @raise Invalid_argument if [srcoff] and [len] do not
    designate a valid subrope of [src], or if [dstoff] and [len]
    do not designate a valid subrope of [dst]. *)

val concat : t -> t list -> t
(** [concat sep sl] concatenates the list of ropes [sl],
    inserting the separator rope [sep] between each. *)

val replace : str:t -> sub:t -> by:t -> bool * t
(** [replace ~str ~sub ~by] returns a tuple constisting of a boolean
    and a rope where the first occurrence of the rope [sub]
    within [str] has been replaced by the rope [by]. The boolean
    is [true] if a substitution has taken place, [false] otherwise. *)

(** {6 Splitting around}*)

val split : t -> t -> t * t
(** [split s sep] splits the rope [s] between the first
    occurrence of [sep].
    @raise Not_found if the separator is not found. *)

(** [rsplit s sep] splits the rope [s] between the last
    occurrence of [sep].
    @raise Not_found if the separator is not found. *)

val nsplit : t -> t -> t list
(** [nsplit s sep] splits the rope [s] into a list of ropes
    which are separated by [sep].
    [nsplit "" _] returns the empty list.
    If the separator is not found, it returns a list of
    the rope [s].
    If two occurrences of the separator are consecutive (with nothing
    in between), the empty rope is added in the sequence. For example,
    [nsplit "a//b/" "/"] is ["a"; ""; "b"; ""].
