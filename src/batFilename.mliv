(** Operations on file names. *)

val current_dir_name : string
(** The conventional name for the current directory (e.g. [.] in Unix). *)

val parent_dir_name : string
(** The conventional name for the parent of the current directory
   (e.g. [..] in Unix). *)

val dir_sep : string
(** The directory separator (e.g. [/] in Unix).
   @since 2.11.0 and OCaml 3.11.2 *)

val concat : string -> string -> string
(** [concat dir file] returns a file name that designates file
   [file] in directory [dir]. *)

val is_relative : string -> bool
(** Return [true] if the file name is relative to the current
   directory, [false] if it is absolute (i.e. in Unix, starts
   with [/]). *)

val is_implicit : string -> bool
(** Return [true] if the file name is relative and does not start
   with an explicit reference to the current directory ([./] or
   [../] in Unix), [false] if it starts with an explicit reference
   to the root directory or the current directory. *)

val check_suffix : string -> string -> bool
(** [check_suffix name suff] returns [true] if the filename [name]
    ends with the suffix [suff].

    Under Windows ports (including Cygwin), comparison is
    case-insensitive, relying on [String.lowercase_ascii].  Note that
    this does not match exactly the interpretation of case-insensitive
    filename equivalence from Windows.  *)

val chop_suffix : string -> string -> string
(** [chop_suffix name suff] removes the suffix [suff] from
   the filename [name]. The behavior is undefined if [name] does not
   end with the suffix [suff]. [chop_suffix_opt] is thus recommended
   instead.
