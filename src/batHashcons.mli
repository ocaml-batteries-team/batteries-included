(** Hash consing of data structures *)

    object contains a unique tag and a hash code. *)

}

  (** A synonym for convenience *)

  (** Comparison on the tags *)

  val clear  : t -> unit

  val hashcons : t -> key -> key hobj
    (** [hashcons tab k] returns either [k], adding it to the table
        [tab] as a side effect, or if [k] is already in the table then
        it returns the hashed object corresponding to that entry.
        @raise Failure if number of objects with the same hash reaches system limit of array size *)
