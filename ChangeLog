## v2.11.0 (minor release)

This minor release fixes a few bugs or interface mismatch with OCaml stdlib,

This is the last planned release of the v2 series.
Next planned release (v3.0.0) will introduce some API changes.

Notable changes:

- Add Unix.with_locked_file
  #904
  (Simon Cruanes, Cedric Cellier, review by Francois Berenger)

- Build with -strict-sequence
  #927
  (Armaël Guéneau, review by Francois Berenger)

- Unix.sleepf is provided across all OCaml versions;
  previously it was only for OCaml >= 4.03.0
  #930
  (Francois Berenger, review by Cedric Cellier)

## v2.10.0 (minor release)

This minor release adds support for OCaml 4.08.0.

This release is compatible with OCaml 4.08.0, but it is not complete
with respect to the standard library of OCaml 4.08.0: this release saw
a lot of changes to the standard library, which have not yet been made
available in the corresponding Batteries module. This means that users
of OCaml 4.08.0 (and Batteries 2.10.0) will have access to these
functions, but users of older OCaml versions (and Batteries 2.10.0)
will not. If you are looking for this kind of backward-compatibility
of new functions, as provided by previous Batteries releases, we
recommend trying the 'stdcompat' library.

- added LazyList.equal: ('a -> 'b -> bool) -> 'a t -> 'b t -> bool
  #811
  (Marshall Abrams, review by Gabriel Scherer)

- added BatList.fold_while : ('acc -> 'a -> bool) -> ('acc -> 'a -> 'acc) ->
                             'acc -> 'a list -> 'acc * 'a list
  #889
  (Francois Berenger, Thibault Suzanne)

- fix `BatNum.of_float_string` on inputs between -1 and 0:
	"-0.5" or "-.5" would be interpreted as "0.5" or ".5".
  #886, #887
  (Gabriel Scherer, report by Marcel Hark)

- added BatHashtbl.merge and merge_all
  #891
  (Cedric Cellier, Francois Berenger, Gabriel Scherer)

- added Unix.with_locked_file
  #904
  (Cedric Cellier, Francois Berenger)

## v2.9.0 (minor release)

This minor release adds support for OCaml 4.07.0, as well as a certain
number of fixes, improvements and documentation clarification from our
contributors. Thanks in particular to Max Mouratov for his varied
contributions.

This release is compatible with OCaml 4.07.0, but it is not complete
with respect to the standard library of OCaml 4.07.0: this release saw
a lot of changes to the standard library, which have not yet been made
available in the corresponding Batteries module. This means that users
of OCaml 4.07.0 (and Batteries 2.9.0) will have access to these
functions, but users of older OCaml versions (and Batteries 2.9.0)
will not. If you are looking for this kind of backward-compatibility
of new functions, as provided by previous Batteries releases, we
recommend trying the new 'stdcompat' library by Thierry Martinez:

  #814
  (Max Mouratov)

- Fix: [Map.update k1 k2 v m] did not work correctly when [k1 = k2].
  #833
  (Max Mouratov)

  in [m], as stated in documentation.
  #833
  (Max Mouratov)

  as stated in documentation.
  #833
  (Max Mouratov)

  raised exceptions
  #840, #754

  instead of the generic [invalid_arg "index out of bounds].
  The assertion is now documented.
  #841
  (Max Mouratov)

  #836
  (Max Mouratov, review by Gabriel Scherer)

- Fix erroneous mentions of [Different_list_size] in List.mli.
  #857, #744
  (Max Mouratov, reported by Christoph Höger)

## v2.8.0 (minor release)

This minor release supports the -safe-string mode for OCaml
compilation, enforcing a type-level separation between (immutable)
strings and mutable byte sequences.

- support -safe-string compilation
  #673
  (Gabriel Scherer)

- Support for the upcoming OCaml release 4.06
  (Gabriel Scherer)

## v2.7.0 (minor release)

This minor release is the first to support OCaml 4.05.0. As with
previous OCaml versions, we backported new 4.05.0 convenience function
from the compiler stdlib, allowing Batteries user to use them with
older OCaml versions, and thus write backward-compatible code. In
particular, the new *_opt functions returning option values instead of
exceptions are all backported.

- BatNum: fix of_float_string to handle negative numbers properly
  #780
  (Anton Yabchinskiy)

- added BatArray.min_max
  #757
  (Francois Berenger)

- added a Label module to BatVect
  #763
  (Varun Gandhi, review by Francois Berenger, Gabriel Scherer, Thibault Suzanne)

- fix documentation of BatVect.insert to match (correct) implementation
  #766, #767
  (Gabriel Scherer, report by Varun Gandhi)

- avoid using exceptions for internal control-flow
  #768, #769
    This purely internal change should improve performances when using
    js_of_ocaml, which generates much slower code for local exceptions
    raising/catching than the native OCaml backend.
    Internal exceptions (trough the BatReturn label) have been removed
    from the modules BatString, BatSubstring and BatVect.
  (Gabriel Scherer, request and review by Clément Pit-Claudel)

- added `BatVect.find_opt : ('a -> bool) -> 'a t -> 'a option`
  and BatVect.Make.find_opt
  #769
  (Gabriel Scherer)

- Documents exceptions for List.(min, max)
  #770
  (Varun Gandhi)

- BatText: bugfixes in `rindex{,_from}` and `rcontains_from`
  #775
  (Gabriel Scherer)

- Support for the new OCaml release 4.05
  the `*_opt` functions and List.compare_lengths, compare_length_with
  are also backported to older OCaml releases, so code using them from
  Batteries should be backwards-compatible
  #777, #779
  (Tej Chajed, Gabriel Scherer)

## v2.6.0 (minor release)

- added Bat{Set,Map,Splay}.any and fixed Bat{Map,Splay}.choose

  (Francois Berenger, Gabriel Scherer)

- Clarification and improvements to the documentation
  #682, #685, #693
  (Florian Angeletti, Johannes Kloos, Michael Färber)

- make `LazyList.split_at` lazy:
  `split_at : int -> 'a t -> 'a t * 'a t`
  would previously eagerly force the prefix of the list
  and only be lazy in its second returned value.
  #694
  (Michael Färber, Gabriel Scherer, Thibault Suzanne)

- Add `List.{map2i,iter2i}`
  #696
  (Thibault Suzanne)

- Added `Result.{map,map_both}`
  #705
  (Ifaz Kabir)

- Add {BatSet,BatMap}.{Int,Int32,Int64,Nativeint,Float,Char,String} as
  common instantions of the respective `Make` functor.
  #709, #712
  (Thibault Suzanne, François Bérenger)

- BatString: add `chop : ?l:int -> ?r:int -> string -> string`
  #714, #716
  (Gabriel Scherer, request by François Bérenger)

- BatSet: make `to_array` allocate the resulting array at first
  instead of using Dynarray (faster, uses less memory).
  #724
  (Thibault Suzanne)

- BatList: add `fold_left_map : ('a -> 'b -> 'a * 'c) -> 'a -> 'b list -> 'a * 'c list`
  #734
  (Thibault Suzanne, review by Gabriel Scherer, request by Oscar Gauthier)

- add ``BatList.frange : float -> [< `To | `Downto ] -> float -> int -> float list``
  ``frange 0. `To 1. 3`` is `[0.; 0.5; 1.]`.
  #745
  (François Bérenger)

## v2.5.3

Batteries 2.5.3 synchronizes library functions with OCaml 4.04+beta2,
and will hopefully be an extension of the upcoming OCaml 4.04 release.

- Compatibility with OCaml 4.04.
  5e63a9a756f
  (Gabriel Scherer)

## v2.5.1, v2.5.2

Batteries 2.5.1 and 2.5.2 fix a silly packaging bug in Batteries 2.5.0.

## v2.5.0

Batteries 2.5.0 is a minor release whose main change is that it is
compatible with the newly released OCaml 4.03.

Note that Batteries 2.5.0 is compatible with older OCaml releases as
well, and provides back-ported versions of most standard library
functions made available in 4.03 only. For example,
BatString.uppercase_ascii is usable under all OCaml versions.

If the documentation of a Batteries function says
  @since 2.5.0
then it is available under all supported OCaml version (3.12.1 and up).
If it says
  @since 2.5.0 and OCaml 4.03.0
then it is only available under OCaml 4.03.0.

- compatibility with 4.02:
  + Printf: remove CamlinternalPr for OCaml versions >= 4.02
    (Ralf Vogler)
  + Printf: legacy code assumed (string = fmt)
    (Gabriel Scherer)
  + new 4.02 functions:
      String.mapi (String.init was already in Batteries)
      List.sort_uniq (List.sort_unique existed before)
      Array.make_float (less efficient implementation provided for <4.02 versions)
      a BatBytes module relying on ocamlfind's compatibility module
      bytes-related functions in Buffer,Digest,Marshal,Printexc,Stream,Unix
      new Printexc callstack interface (not available for <4.02 versions)
    (Gabriel Scherer)
